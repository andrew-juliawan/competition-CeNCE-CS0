# Competition

This repository contains my working from coding contests I have participated in. 

## CeNCE-CS0
CeNCE-CS0 is a coding contest on 2 August hosted on the **Coursemology** website. The contest consists of 5 questions and participants are expected to solve all problems using a **local IDE** (IDLE) on Python within 2 hours. CS0 covers topics about strings, tuples, lists, functions, nested loops, data abstraction, and common problem solving techniques.
