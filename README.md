## 📜 Context: What is CeNCE?
The **Centre for Nurturing Computing Excellence (CeNCE)** is a specialized initiative focused on fostering advanced computing talent, particularly in the area of competitive programming.

| Detail | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Mission & Objective** | CeNCE's core mission is to nurture the next generation of computing leaders by providing rigorous training and contest exposure. It aims to elevate computational thinking, problem-solving skills, and algorithm mastery among aspiring students, bridging the gap between foundational programming and elite competitive standards (like ICPC and IOI). |

## ⭐ My Motivation

My participation in the CeNCE CS0 competition was driven by clear personal and academic goals:

1.  **To test my Python skill in a competition stage:** The CS0 level, focused on foundational programming concepts, provided an excellent environment to stress-test my command of Python under competitive time constraints.
2.  **To test the water to have learning experience at NUS School of Computing:** Engaging with a program developed by the NUS School of Computing offered an invaluable opportunity to experience the level of rigor and academic standard upheld by the university.

## 🏆 Achievement & Proof

My dedication and preparation culminated in a merit achievement in the competition:

CeNCE-CS0 is a coding competition held on 2 August hosted on the **Coursemology** platform and organized by the **NUS School of Computing**. The contest consists of 5 questions, all of which participants are required to solve using a **local IDE** (IDLE) on Python within 2 hours. CS0 covers topics about strings, tuples, lists, functions, nested loops, data abstraction, and common problem solving techniques.

I wanted to participate in CeNCE-CS0 to gain practical experience and strengthen my portfolio. When I first enrolled in the competition, I already had some prior experience with Python; however, I recognized that there were areas where my understanding was still limited. To address this, I spent two weeks studying the instructional videos and completing the problem sets prepared by the organizers to improve my skills and master the required material. As a result of my preparation and effort, I was awarded merit after the contest.
