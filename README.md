## CeNCE-CS0
CeNCE-CS0 is a coding competition held on 2 August hosted on the **Coursemology** platform and organized by the NUS School of Computing. The contest consists of 5 questions, all of which participants are required to solve using a **local IDE** (IDLE) on Python within 2 hours. CS0 covers topics about strings, tuples, lists, functions, nested loops, data abstraction, and common problem solving techniques.

I wanted to participate in CeNCE-CS0 to gain practical experience and strengthen my portfolio. When I first enrolled in the competition, I already had some prior experience with Python; however, I recognized that there were areas where my understanding was still limited. To address this, I spent two weeks studying the instructional videos and completing the problem sets prepared by the organizers to improve my skills and master the required material. As a result of my preparation and effort, I was awarded merit after the contest.
