## 📜 Context: What is CeNCE?
The **Centre for Nurturing Computing Excellence (CeNCE)** is a specialized initiative focused on fostering advanced computing talent, particularly in the area of competitive programming.

| Detail | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Mission & Objective** | CeNCE's core mission is to nurture the next generation of computing leaders by providing rigorous training and contest exposure. It aims to elevate computational thinking, problem-solving skills, and algorithm mastery among aspiring students, bridging the gap between foundational programming and elite competitive standards (like ICPC and IOI). |

## ⭐ My Motivation

My participation in the CeNCE CS0 competition was driven by clear personal and academic goals:

1.  **To test my Python skill in a competition stage:** The CS0 level, focused on foundational programming concepts, provided an excellent environment to stress-test my command of Python under competitive time constraints.
2.  **To test the water to have learning experience at NUS School of Computing:** Engaging with a program developed by the NUS School of Computing offered an invaluable opportunity to experience the level of rigor and academic standard upheld by the university.

## 🚧 Challenges Faced

The road to the competition presented significant hurdles that required high dedication:

1.  **Short / limited time to learn:** Balancing the demands of preparing for a high-stakes competition with other commitments meant resources and time for preparation were severely constrained.
2.  **The competition concurrent with school exams:** The overlap of the competition timeline with crucial school examinations required intense scheduling and management of focus between academic responsibilities and competitive training.

## 📚 Preparation Method

Despite the challenges, I employed a focused and intensive preparation strategy:

* I spent **two weeks** thoroughly studying the instructional videos and completing the problem sets prepared and provided by the NUS School of Computing team. This was done to rapidly improve my skills and master the required material within the limited timeframe.

## 🏆 Achievement & Proof

My dedication and preparation culminated in a merit achievement in the competition:
